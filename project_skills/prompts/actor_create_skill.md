You must create one new skill because the current library is insufficient for the task.

Design objectives:
1. Use the gold trajectory as the main source of procedural knowledge.
2. Generalize beyond the exact instance. The skill should cover the broader task family when that can be done safely.
3. Make the description highly triggerable: include what the skill does and when to use it.
4. Use progressive disclosure. Keep `SKILL.md` focused; move long checklists, examples, or edge-case references into `references/`.
5. If the task repeatedly requires arithmetic, parsing, batching, or path handling, include a reusable script in `scripts/`.
6. The skill must be usable by a weaker executor model. Make defaults explicit and reduce ambiguity.
7. When you reference a script in the skill body, explicitly instruct the executor to call `run_python_script` with `script_path="scripts/..."`. Do not write the script path as if it were a standalone tool name.

Current task:
{task_json}

Critic reward:
{reward_json}

Existing skills:
{existing_skills_json}

Return exactly one JSON object:
{{
  "summary": "what this new skill adds and why",
  "target_skill_name": "lowercase-hyphen-name",
  "files_to_write": {{
    "SKILL.md": "---\\nname: ...",
    "references/REFERENCE.md": "... optional ...",
    "scripts/helper.py": "... optional ..."
  }},
  "files_to_delete": [],
  "merged_from": [],
  "experience_entry": {{
    "failure_signature": "compact failure signature",
    "affected_skills": ["target_skill_name"],
    "modification_summary": "what the new skill teaches"
  }}
}}

Hard requirements for `SKILL.md`:
1. The frontmatter must include `name` and `description`.
2. The skill directory name and `name` must match.
3. Add `allowed-tools` when the workflow can be narrowed to a stable subset of tools.
4. The body must contain concrete execution guidance, not generic advice.
5. Include clear tool-use defaults.
6. If a script is introduced, the instructions must explicitly tell the executor when to call it.
