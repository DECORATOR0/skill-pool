You must revise one existing skill in response to the critic reward.

Revision objectives:
1. Fix the specific failure mode with the smallest reliable change.
2. Incorporate prior similar failures from the NL-Experience Buffer when useful.
3. Prefer explicit defaults, few-shot examples, path conventions, and scripts over vague prose.
4. If the skill is too long or the reward mentions context overload, move details into `references/`.
5. If the task failed because the executor guessed numbers, paths, or logic, add a script or a stricter tool-use rule.
6. Preserve the skill's useful prior coverage.
7. Tighten `allowed-tools` when reducing executor drift would help.
8. If the skill uses bundled scripts, explicitly instruct the executor to invoke them through `run_python_script` rather than treating file paths as tool names.
