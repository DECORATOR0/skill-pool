You must merge overlapping skills into one broader skill.

Merge principles:
1. Preserve the strongest reusable guidance from each source skill.
2. Remove redundancy and contradictory instructions.
3. Write a new description that broadens trigger coverage without becoming vague.
4. Keep the merged `SKILL.md` concise; move specialized sections into `references/` when needed.
5. If multiple source skills rely on repeated code logic, consolidate that logic into scripts.
6. Add a narrow `allowed-tools` frontmatter field when the merged workflow has a stable tool subset.
7. If scripts are referenced, describe them as `run_python_script` calls rather than as standalone tool names.
